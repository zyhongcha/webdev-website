<h2>Hello.</h2>
<p>
My name is Zyhong Liu. I am a 25-year-old full-time employed full-stack web developer and freelancer based in Cologne, Germany.
I am not a typical "IT guy". Right out of university, I have started my career by launching an innovative Asian retail franchise with a team of 4, acting as a co-founder and purchasing manager, following my passion to promote Asian food culture in Germany. Unfortunately, this project ended two years later. However, throughout the years, I was fortunate to get to know many businesses working between Europe and Asia. I have learned a vast amount of business insights and practices that make Asian businesses in Europe (and vice-versa) flourish, but just as myself, I have also experienced many European and Asian businesses go unprofitable due to lack of understanding between cultures and communications.


As a tech-inclined German-Cantonese, I grew up right between Western and Asian values, and I love to use my expertise in supporting these businesses in the area of web presentation, SEO/Online Marketing and Asian food expertise (specifically tea and Sake).

As for web development, I aim to create clean and user-friendly designs that is true to the customer's style. I develop modern web-solutions while writing efficient code, focusing on minimalizing bloat and optimizing speed performance.
Regardless of what job I do, I have always loved to get heavily invested into creating new ideas, connecting cultures and showcasing them with a contemporary touch. </p>
