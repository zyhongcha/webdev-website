<h2>Hello.</h2>
<p>
My name is Zyhong Liu. I am a 25-year-old full-stack web developer based in Cologne, Germany.
However, I am not your typical "IT guy". Right out of university, I have started my work-life by launching an innovative Asian retail franchise with a team of 4, acting as a co-founder and purchasing manager and following my passion to promote Asian food culture in Germany. This project ended two years later due to financial reasons. Throughout the years, I met many people, to whom I have worked with as a freelancer, supporting them in relation to SEO/online marketing and Asian food expertise. Nowadays, my activities include helping businesses in creating or refreshing their web presentation. I aim to create clean and modern designs that is true to the customer's style, while at the same time, I write efficient code, focusing on minimalizing bloat for the system and optimizing page speed performance.
Regardless of what job I do, I have always loved to get heavily invested into reinventing things, showcasing them in a different light.</p>
